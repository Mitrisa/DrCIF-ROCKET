# DrRocket: Integrating DrCIF and ROCKET for Time Series Classification

This repository contains the code, results, and documentation of the Scientific Initiation project developed at the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, under the **Unified Scholarship Program (PUB)**.  
The study investigates a variation of the **DrCIF** classifier, in which the original interval-based features are replaced by **features extracted through the ROCKET algorithm**, aiming to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Objectives

This project aims to **investigate new algorithms for time series classification** that achieve computational efficiency **without sacrificing predictive performance**.  
The proposal replaces the traditional statistical features of **DrCIF** with **random convolutional representations** extracted by **ROCKET**, creating a hybrid classifier called **DrRocket**.

This integration seeks to understand the relationship between **computational cost**, **number of kernels**, and **predictive accuracy**, with a focus on real-world applications — especially in the **health domain**, where both efficiency and robustness are crucial.

## Methods

Four main configurations were evaluated:

| Model | Description | # Kernels |
|:-------|:------------|:----------:|
| **DrCIF** | Original model using interval-based statistical features | – |
| **DrRocket-4** | Replaces features with 4 random convolutional kernels from ROCKET | 4 |
| **DrRocket-50** | Intermediate version with more diverse convolutional patterns | 50 |
| **DrRocket-100** | Extended version to test performance saturation | 100 |

Experiments were conducted on **21 datasets** from the [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Archive](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/), evaluating the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**
- **Training and testing time**

## Results

### Execution Time
The **original DrCIF** showed the highest computational cost, mainly due to its complex feature extraction process.  
In contrast, the **ROCKET-based variants** drastically reduced training and testing time, especially **DrRocket-4**, which achieved an average runtime below 20 seconds.

### Trade-off Between Cost and Performance
The figure below illustrates the relationship between training time and average accuracy across the 21 datasets.

- **DrRocket-4** is the fastest but shows significant accuracy losses.  
- **DrRocket-100** increases computational cost with minimal accuracy gains.  
- **DrRocket-50** provides **the best balance** between efficiency and predictive performance.

### 📈 Statistical Comparison
The **Critical Difference Diagram** (Figure 3) shows that **DrRocket-50** achieved the best average performance among the hybrid variants, without statistically significant differences from the original DrCIF.

## Conclusions

Replacing DrCIF’s interval-based features with ROCKET’s convolutional features proved to be a **viable and efficient alternative**.  
Among all configurations, **DrRocket-50** emerged as the most promising version, achieving accuracy comparable to the original DrCIF while **drastically reducing computational time**.

These findings indicate that combining **interval forests** and **random convolutions** can produce classifiers that are both **scalable and competitive**, maintaining predictive reliability while improving efficiency.
